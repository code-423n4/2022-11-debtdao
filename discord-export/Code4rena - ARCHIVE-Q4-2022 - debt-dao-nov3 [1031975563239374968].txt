what is the difference between Revenue Tokens and Credit Tokens, can you give an example for each?


[11/01/2022 23:22] chaduke3730
The former is a token for collateral? The later is the token that one can borrow - a stable coin?

Would depositAndClose always close the first line ?


[11/02/2022 08:52] bobzedf
depositAndClose() allows a Borrower to close an individual credit line.  

The FIFO repayment queue ensures that credit lines are repaid (partially or fully/closed) in the order in which they were originally drawn down by a Borrower.  

So whenever a Borrower deposits to repay, those funds are allocated to the first credit line (identified by an 'id') in the queue.

Kek 

[11/04/2022 16:41] bobzedf
As it's coded today, the status of a Line of Credit can be one of uninitialized, active, liquidatable, repaid or insolvent.

Impaired is not an official status but obviously if that word is used it means there's a problem, a doubt that full repayment can be made of principal and interest.

Starting in reverse with the INSOLVENT status, this will be declared by an Arbiter if a Borrower is permanently incapable of repaying debt AFTER actions were taken when the status is LIQUIDATABLE.

If the status is LIQUIDATABLE (for whatever reason), then there are 3 ways a Lender can recover funds (depending on what contracts are deployed/what terms agreed between parties).  We've an explainer on this here: https://docs.debtdao.finance/products/line-of-credit/loan-impairment-and-lender-recourse

If you need further assistance, please ask.


[11/04/2022 17:18] cwalk_19
the fRate (facility rate) is applied only when the borrower does not use the funds deposited into the LoC contract by a lender. once the borrower draws down on the deposits into the LoC, the dRate (drawn rate) is charged


[11/04/2022 17:19] cwalk_19
so in short.. yes, the lender gets the fRate on remaining funds not used by the borrower @Koolex


[11/04/2022 17:29] bobzedf
Thanks!  I missed that one!


[11/04/2022 17:37] koolexc
Thank you guys. @Bob @cwalk 
What if the borrower doesn't need the remaining funds anymore? Is there a business logic that covers this case or is it fixed upon the agreement in the first place and can't be changed later?

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[11/04/2022 17:48] jumpdest7d
So the fRate is like a punitive fee on funds provisioned for the borrower but not consumed by the same?


[11/04/2022 17:53] bobzedf
Think of it as a reward for the Lender for making available capital (to cover its opportunity cost) and the cost of the option premium to the Borrower of having the capital available.


[11/04/2022 18:08] jumpdest7d
Thank you! That clears it up üôåüôå


[11/04/2022 18:49] cwalk_19
if they don't need the remaining funds anymore, they can call close () function. 

to your point about if it is fixed or can be changed later, a borrower could theoretically negotiate with a lender and change the fRate to a lower rate via setRates function

You could deploy and Escrowed Line of Credit or a Spigoted Line of Credit on their own.  So, yes is the answer.

You could even deploy an unsecured Line of Credit for some use cases where you perceive no credit risk but we don't advise this and we make this clear in our docs (Gitbook).

We anticipate that mainly Secured Lines will be deployed and this gives the option of backing up the security provided by the Spigot with a more traditional collateral approach via the Escrow contract.

how do lenders and borrow agree to terms? Is there a separate contract for that?


[11/05/2022 19:50] jumpdest7d
They agree out-of-band and then use the mutualConsentById modifier on ILineOfCredit.setRates to capture an approval signature from both parties.


[11/05/2022 19:51] jumpdest7d
The agreement is captured through the combined signature of borrower and lender, and this must be done before the rates can be set.

[11/05/2022 19:54] jumpdest7d
Also see LineOfCredit.addCredit - it uses the modifier too üëç


[11/05/2022 19:58] bobzedf
At the moment it's right that there's offline agreements needed but this will gradually change as the MarketPlace evolves, pools, delegate etc.

It's possible in an early version that pre-deployed Lines will be available and a Lender can pick and choose and then simply addCredit() to complete the 2/2 of mutual consent.

For sure like all novel stuff there will be some high touch focus, especially around the Spigot's control of Revenue Contracts but once that initial work is done and tested then that Spigot/Revenue contract can be reused for n Lines of Credit.  The same for a collateral escrow.

{Reactions}
üëç (2) 

[11/05/2022 20:03] bobzedf
That's the main mutual consent function.  Before that a Line can be deployed by a Borrower with terms x, y and z.  That's like an empty shell.  A Lender then calls addCredit() with those terms x, y, z whatever and executes the 2/2 mutual consent in order to create the first credit line id on the Line of Credit facility.

LineOfCredit.setRates is to change rates on an already ACTIVE LIne

increaseCredit() is for a Lender to add more credit (I.e. deposit more) to an existing credit line id.

All these 3 require mutual consent.

Ok Wardens I'm signing off for today.  Other team members should be available but if you don't see them and you see me you can still DM me.  Otherwise I'll be back here 0800 UTC Sunday.

@BobThanks.

I'm trying to use console.log to print out values but it is not working
`Compiler run failed
error[7576]: DeclarationError: Undeclared identifier.`
Usually I use this and it works. is there a configuration of something in foundry that disables this?


[11/06/2022 10:51] bobzedf
gm.  @mostarz93 or another team member can address this point but please wait a few hours until they're up and able on the other side of the pond.

No, we use it too during development


[11/07/2022 09:31] 0x1f8b
ModuleFactory.sol is not under scope?


[11/07/2022 10:28] bobzedf
@kiba pls confirm.  Thanks


[11/07/2022 10:30] 0x1f8b
It doesn't appear in the scope, but seems weird to me because it's the unique file that is not in the scope, and is not a big one

[11/07/2022 14:03] kibagateaux
Correct


[11/07/2022 14:04] kibagateaux
It's basically only 2 lines of code


[11/07/2022 17:02] perseverancesuccess2021
Hello, I have a question. @kiba  In the POC section, it see that it is asked to provide Github link. But Github access is granted based on username. How can I report and use Github? I can use the Google_Drive link, but of course it is not as convenient as Github for the sponsors or judge to check.

Are these vector explicitly out of scope?


[11/09/2022 02:05] kibagateaux
yes


[11/09/2022 02:06] kibagateaux
these are most of the externally caused exploits. we dont mention things like arbiter having ability to add toxic assets as collateral or whatever because thats an inherent risk of our contracts
